# Exercise 4
The task was to create a sequence of wide cords from ascending and descending Gm and DM scales.

## Cords
#### Gm:
 - t(5/3)	III(6/4)	VI(7)	II(6/4)	V(6/5)	VI(4/3) 	IV(9-7)		t(6/4)
 - t(6/4) 	III(6/4)	VII(7)	t(5/3)	IV(6/4)		VI(6/3)		V(6/4)		t(5/3)

#### DM
 - T(5/3)	II(2)	VI(6/5)	IV(6/3)	T(6/3)	II(6/5)	V(5/3)	T(6/4)
 - II(7)	DM:III(2)/AM:VI(2)	AM:VII(4/3)		DM:V(6/3)/AM:T(6/3)	VII(2)	T(6/4)	V(5/3)	T(6/3)
