The task was to create a sequence of 10-20 chords in EM→G#m→BM→F#m scales, then create melody and arpeggio tracks.

## Chords
EM:T(5/3) 	EM:IV(6/4) 	EM:VII(7)#3#5/G#m:V(2)	G#m:T(6/4)
G#m:IV(7) 	G#m:V(6/4) 	G#m:VII(4/3)/BM:V(4/3)	BM:T(6/3)*
BM:III(5/3) 	BM:IV(2)	BM:II(6/5) 	BM:V(2)
BM:T(6/4) 	BM:VI(2)/F#m:VII(7)	F#m:V(6/5) 	F#m:T(5/3)
